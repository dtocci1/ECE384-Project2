% 1. Generate sequences, at least 10000 points long, of the following two
% random variables:

% (a) A uniform random variable X1 in the range of [0 3]


% (b) A uniform random variable X2 in the range of [0 5].


% 2. Obtain a new random variable as a sum: Y = X1 + X2.


% 3. Measure the PDFs of X1, X2 and Y .


% 4. Plot the measured PDFs along with the corresponding theoretical PDFs. Compare and comment on the results.
